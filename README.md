# go-bitstream

`go-bitstream` is a toy library for bit-level marshaling and unmarshaling in Go. This package is designed to handle streams of bits, which are not necessarily byte-sized or byte-aligned. It includes various utilities for appending and extracting bits, integers, and big integers to and from a bitstream. The package also supports base32 encoding and decoding.

## Key Features

- Append and extract individual bits, bytes, and integers.
- Support for appending and extracting big integers.
- Base32 encoding and decoding.
- Utility functions for bit manipulation.
